# Accelerometer Data

Describes each of the variables in the two files "AccelerometerData.txt" and "AverageAccelerometerData.txt"

## "AccelerometerData.txt"

### Column 1: Activity Label
Integer value taking one of the following values:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6

Labels what the test subject was doing when the accelerometer measurement was taken

### Column 2: Activity Name
Character value taking one of the following values:

- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

The values in this column have a 1 to 1 relation with the values in column 1 as follows:

- 1 : WALKING
- 2 : WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- 3 : WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- 4 : SITTING
- 5 : STANDING
- 6 : LAYING

### Column 3: Subject ID
Integer taking a value between 1 and 30

Each unique value corresponds to a different test subject

### Columns 4 - 69: Accelerometer Data
Real numeric value between -1 and 1

Each column name indicates the specific type of measurement value, with the following format:

> (Domain)(Object)(Reading Type)(Aggregate Function)(Axis Orientation)

Here is an example

> tBodyGyroJerkMeanZ

The following describes each component from the format above

#### Domain
One character indicating whether the reading is a time domain signal (t) or if a Fast Fourier Transform was performed to get the value (f)

#### Object
Either 'Gravity' or 'Body'

#### Reading Type
One of the following:

- Acc
- AccJerk
- Gyro
- GyroJerk
- AccMag
- AccJerkMag
- GyroMag
- GyroJerkMag
- BodyAccJerkMag
- BodyGyroMag
- BodyGyroJerkMag

#### Aggregate Function
Either 'Mean' or 'Std'

#### Axis Orientation  (optional)
Either 'X', 'Y', or 'Z'

Axis along which the reading is oriented

This is not present for magnitude reading types (reading types containing 'mag')




## "AverageAccelerometerData.txt"

Gives the average value accelerometer data for each unique combination of subject and ID and activity name

### Column 1: Activity Name
Character value taking one of the following values:

- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

### Column 2: Subject ID
Integer taking a value between 1 and 30

Each unique value corresponds to a different test subject

### Columns 3 - 68: Accelerometer Data
Real numeric value between -1 and 1

Each column name indicates the specific type of measurement value, with the following format:

> (Domain)(Object)(Reading Type)(Aggregate Function)(Axis Orientation)Average

Here is an example

> tBodyGyroJerkMeanZAverage

The following describes each component from the format above

#### Domain
One character indicating whether the reading is a time domain signal (t) or if a Fast Fourier Transform was performed to get the value (f)

#### Object
Either 'Gravity' or 'Body'

#### Reading Type
One of the following:

- Acc
- AccJerk
- Gyro
- GyroJerk
- AccMag
- AccJerkMag
- GyroMag
- GyroJerkMag
- BodyAccJerkMag
- BodyGyroMag
- BodyGyroJerkMag

#### Aggregate Function
Either 'Mean' or 'Std'

#### Axis Orientation  (optional)
Either 'X', 'Y', or 'Z'

Axis along which the reading is oriented

This is not present for magnitude reading types (reading types containing 'mag')

#### Average
Each value in this dataset is an average of measurements so all columns are appended with 'Average'
